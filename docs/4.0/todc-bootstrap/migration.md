This list highlights key changes by component between v3.x.x and v4.0.0.

### Breaking

### Buttons

  - Flat buttons
    - The optional `.btn-flat` modifier class has been removed.

### Navs

  - Tabs

    - `.navbar-masthead` has been replaced by `.navbar-lg`.
    - `.navbar-sm` is the size of the old the `.navbar`.
